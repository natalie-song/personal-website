		<h3 id="question">how was the universe created?</h3>
			<p id="answer">I believe the universe was created naturally, presumable in the form of the Big Bang, in which a massive blast created all the matter and energy, including time and space. From then, the world developed and evolved until life originated.
		<h3 id="question">what does it mean to be a human being?</h3>
			<p id="answer">The meaning of human-ness has many facets. Biologically, it means your genes dictate that you are an organism belonging to the homo sapien species. It is my personal opinion that it is wrong to say that to be human is to feel intense emotion or to love or to be capable of complex thought. There are people who are not capable of these things. They are afflicted with certain ailments that don't allow it. Therefore, the only true, objective meaning of humanity is to be a member of the homo sapien species.</p>
		<h3 id="question">what happens when you die?</h3>
			<p id="answer">I would like to think that after you die you are able to go live in paradise or watch over your loved ones from above. But really, that's not what I truly believe. It is my belief that after we die, we - in our bodily form - cease to exist. Our physical bodies rot and deteriorate to nothingness. We are not truly dead though; we live on through the legacy we have created while we were still alive. </p>
